    before:

    ```yml
    payum:
        a_context:
            a_factory:
                api:
                    options:
                        foo: foo
                        bar: bar
    ```

    after:

    ```yml
    payum:
        a_context:

                foo: foo
                bar: bar
    ```

                        doctrine:
                            driver: orm
    ```
    
    after: 
    
    ```yml
    payum:
        storages:
            Acme\PaymentBundle\Entity\PaymentDetails:
                payment:
                    contexts: [a_factory]
                doctrine: orm
